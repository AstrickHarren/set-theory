# Preface {-}

The famous Russell's paradox says not everything is a set, in particular 
$$
R = \{ x : x \notin x \}
$$
is not a set because $R \in R \iff R \notin R$. Hence, the existence of a certain set requires reason. An alternative way was devised by Zermelo and Fraenkel to found the existence of all sets upon a set of axioms that have not led to paradoxes for years, to which we give our deepest interest here in the book.
